# terminal.js
Terminal.js is a lightweight, easy to use terminal interface for the web. (Note: This does not actually _run_ Javascript code)
Currently, terminal.js has only been tested on HTML, but I may add support for other platforms in the future.

# Installation
Import either (dark.css and darkextra.css) or (light.css and lightextra.css) into your page. Also import terminal.js.

# Usage
Create a new terminal by using the following tag:
```html
<terminal-js></terminal-js>
```

## Editing Commands
To edit a command, add, remove or modify the COMMANDS array in terminal.js.
